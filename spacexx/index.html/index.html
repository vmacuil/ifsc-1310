    <h2>Dragon Vehicle Overview:
    </h2>
    <p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. 
      Dragon made history in 2012 when it became the first commercial spacecraft in history to deliver cargo 
      to the International Space Station and safely return cargo to Earth, a feat previously achieved only by governments. 
      It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth. Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.

      <ul>
        <li>FACILITATING RESEARCH: DragonLab is a platform designed for research and testing in a microgravity environment, independent of the International Space Station. It provides a free-flying, unmanned platform for conducting experiments and research.</li>
        <li>LONGEVITY: DragonLab is capable of transporting payloads, experiments, instruments, and sensors into space and back to Earth on missions ranging from one week to two years. This makes it ideal for conducting long-term research and testing.</li>
        <li>CAPABILITIES: DragonLab is versatile and can accommodate a wide range of experiments and tests. It is suitable for instrument and sensor testing, space physics and relativity experiments, radiation effects research, and many other microgravity tests. Its flexibility makes it an ideal choice for a wide range of research and testing applications.</li>

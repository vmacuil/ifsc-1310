  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>The SpaceX web assignment was a valuable experience for me in terms of learning more about HTML and CSS. By studying and analyzing the design choices made by SpaceX, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of how to create effective web designs. I also learned a lot about the importance of good design principles, such as using whitespace effectively and creating a clear hierarchy of information.

    The assignment also gave me the opportunity to practice my HTML and CSS skills by implementing the design in a web page. Through this process, I was able to identify areas where I needed to improve my skills and work on developing my proficiency in CSS and positioning. Overall, the SpaceX web assignment was a great learning experience that helped me to grow as a web developer.</p>
